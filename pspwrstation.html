<h3><b><p>The power station used to run on coal, when it was still operational, and began operating sometime between 1967 and 1969, and was named as “The UK’s least carbon-efficient power station” in 2005 by a World Wide Fund for Nature. There is a sign with Port Seton’s achievements near where the Power Plant used to be.</p></b></h3>
<h3><b><p>The power station was created by Sir Robert Hogg Matthew, and used to generate 1200 Megawatts of power, on a 24 hectare site, which is 59.3053 Acres of land, or 240000.0342 M² before being discontinued on the 15th of March in 2013, and went out in a bang in September of 2015. The Power Plant is thought to have been the hiding place of Lieutenant-General Sir John (Jonathan) Cope after his army was defeated during the first significant battle of the Jacobite Rising in 1745, known as the Battle of Prestonpans, which has been cemented in history by the song “Hey Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet?”, or other variants of that name.</p></b></h3>
<h3><b><p>Coal was originally brought from the Deep Mines from Midlothian Coalfield before it was closed/exhausted of resources, after which, the power plant got coal from open cast mines in the Lothians, Lanarkshire, Fife and Ayrshire, after which, the power plant changed to Russian Coal, namely due to the fact it released less Sulphur Oxide into the air, and was the first to use a “merry-go-round” system of delivery, which means the power plant used block trains to deliver coal via hopper wagons (the train cars with no roof, and used for ores as well, they slope inwards) in 1966.</p></b></h3>
