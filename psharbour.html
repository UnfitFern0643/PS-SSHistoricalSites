<h2><b><P>Port Seton Harbour was created during the 17th century between 1655-1665 by George Seton, the 10th Lord Seton, and 5th Earl of Winston, which was the 1st ever harbour at the place now called Port Seton, which was where Port Seton got its name, and the harbour was named as such to distinguish it from the Cockenzie Harbour nearby.</P></b></h2>
<h2><b><P>The 1st Waggon Way in Scotland (created in 1722) lead from Tranent all the way to Port Seton Harbour from the coal mines, which was 2 ½ Miles long, and most of the trades for coal and salt came from/went to the port Seton Harbour, but the Harbour was barely useable by 1810, namely due to the storms and neglect. In 1815, the wagonway was converted into Iron rails for the future North British Railway, built in 1846.</P></b></h2>
<h2><b><P>The land of Port Seton Harbour used to belong to George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton before the Jacobite Rising in 1750 when he sided with James “The Old Pretender” Stuart, in which his land was forfeit, becoming The Crown’s land, which was acquisitioned by the York Buildings Company in 1719, which was when Port Seton Harbour gained some improvements, which were finished in 1722.</P></b></h2>
